		<i>The C Programming Language</i>
	</div>
	<span>
		 The de facto authority on the C language
		<span>
			The first edition of the book, published in 1978, was the first widely available book on the C programming language
		</span>
		<span>
			<i>The C Programming Language</i> has often been cited as a model for technical writing, due to the book's clear presentation and concise treatment. In just 228 pages (272 pages in the second edition), the book covers C comprehensively. Examples generally consist of complete programs of the type one is likely to encounter in daily usage of the language, with an emphasis on system programming. The technical details of C are balanced by my observations on good programming practice, which are immediately illustrated with concrete, realistic examples.
