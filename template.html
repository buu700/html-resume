				<i>The C Programming Language</i>
			</div>
			<span>
				The de facto authority on the C language
				<span>
					The first edition of the book, published in 1978, was the
					first widely available book on the C programming language
				</span>
				<span>
					<i>The C Programming Language</i> has often been cited as a
					model for technical writing, due to the book's clear
					presentation and concise treatment. In just 228 pages (272
					pages in the second edition), the book covers C
					comprehensively. Examples generally consist of complete
					programs of the type one is likely to encounter in daily
					usage of the language, with an emphasis on system
					programming. The technical details of C are balanced by my
					observations on good programming practice, which are
					immediately illustrated with concrete, realistic examples.
